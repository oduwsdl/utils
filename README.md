# WSDL Utility Scripts

This repository is aimed to collect assorted utility scripts for various tasks that do not warrant an independent repository, but still useful enough for sharing. These scripts can be in any programming language. Feel free to add your own here. Please try to follow the following guidelines:

* Independently runnable
* Contain appropriate shebang and made executable if applicable
* Properly named files and organized in appropriate directory structure
* Contain some documentation in the header in each file to describe the purpose and usage
* Do not include sensitive or private information of the group
